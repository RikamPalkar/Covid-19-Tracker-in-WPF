# Covid-19-Tracker-in-WPF
Introduction
 
Hi folks, If you remember recently I had published a website for Covid 19 Tracker with React. How about we explore our strength in WPF.
 
Almost everything is different in these 2 projects. They follow different implementation techniques with respect to their technologies.
 
Let's create a WPF application with an attractive UI. This project is for education purpose only.


Features of the app,

    Attractive UI
    Easy to use
    Charts & numbers speak more than text
    Real-time data
    Calculating recovery & fatality rate for each country.
    Calculating Affected, Recovered & death count as per country.
    Learn how to create ComboBox with Material design in WPF.
    Binding of Combobox in WPF.
    How to reuse the same function to call 'n' number of API calls.

Things you will learn in this project,

    Using a material design with WPF to enhance the user experience
    Creating styles for a specific page or application-wide
    Calling Web-API in any C# backed project with a HttpClient
    Binding ViewModel Properties with View using MVVM architecture.
